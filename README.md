## 💫Hi!
My name is Claudia and I’m a Computer Science student specializing in Cybersecurity.

I love studying and learning, I’m very dedicated to my studies, so I decided to create this space on the internet where I can share my knowledge, notes, projects, as well as useful links and resources.

Let’s learn and grow together!✨  


This is an extension of [Claudia's Library on Notion](https://claudiaslibrary.notion.site/Welcome-to-Claudia-s-Library-12a19f75683280f7af7ec17732da7c20), here you will find the code of my projects.  
  
Collaborations are very welcome!⭐️

<!---
ClaudiasLibrary/ClaudiasLibrary is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
